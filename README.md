# trajectoryMining
Based on the trajectory, classify the car into two classes (private car / uber car) by using CNN.

- The target is to construct a classifier to classify the car into two classes (private car OR uber car).

- Sample dataset is provided, which contains trajectories of 300 cars in Shanghai.

- Visualize the trajectory data may help you have a general understanding about the driving patterns.

- This project is mainly composed of two parts. 
    - In the first part, we map the trajectory data into a matrix.

    - In the second part, we train a CNN as the classifier since the matrix can be considered as a single channel image.
