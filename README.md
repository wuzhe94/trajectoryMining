# trajectoryMining
Based on the trajectory, classify the car into two classes (private car / uber car) by using CNN.

- The dataset contains trajectories of 300 cars in Shanghai. 

- The target is to develop a classifier to classify the car into two classes (private car OR uber car).

- This project is mainly composed of two parts. 
    - In the first part, we map the trajectory data to a matrix. 
    - In the second part, we train a CNN as the classifier since the matrix can be considered as a single channel image.

- For more details, please refer to the code. If there is any doubts, feel free to contact me.
